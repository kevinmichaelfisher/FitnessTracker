(DONE_ can only track workout 1 now, make it track workouts 2-4 also

make sure everything obeys single responsibility principle

read measurements from db and display them in the chart

implement various error checking code

after all the backend stuff is done, redo the placeholder gui

redo with mvc structure?
  model=observable, view=observer
    this means any time the model changes, it notifies the view, which can then update the guy
  controller=actionlistener
    set the action listener of each button, etc. to be an instance of the controller

mvc ideas
Controllers will implement ActionListener
Have two controllers: guiController and applicationDataController
If the component triggered (button in my case) only changes the gui and doesn't need to interact with 
	the model (e.g. a button is pressed that only switches screens), attach a guiController to it. The
	guiController will then eventually call a method in guiCardLayout that will change to the appropriate
	card.
If the component triggered has to interact with the model (reading/writing from db), then attach a
	applicationDataController to it. If it's a read event, the applicationDataController will need to 
	determine what information will need to be read, then access the model to get that info. If it's a 
	write event, then the controller will need to access guiCardLayout first to get this information. 
	Probably do this by having a method for each "form" in the program, and if that method is called,
	it will gather all the info from the appropriate J components and return it (e.g. 
	getSaveAWorkoutFormInfo will access all of the JTextFields in the SaveAWorkout form). Once the
	applicationDataController has all of this information, it will pass it on to the model, who then
	decides what to do.
	
This all assumes that some parts of the mvc have references to other parts:
guiCardLayout will have a reference to each of the controllers.
	It will have a method called addController(controller) which will add a controller to some buttons
		as a listener.
	Any button created will either have a guiController or applicationDataController as an event listener
Each controller will have a reference to guiCardLayout and any appropriate models
	They will have a method called addModel(model) and addView(view)
Models don't have references to either.  Models will extend Observable and views (i.e. guiCardLayout
	will implement Observer. Whenever the state changes in the model, it will notifyObservers();
	
In guiCardLayout, we can't add a listener to a button right when it's created, because we won't have
	a reference to the controller yet. So add code in addController() that sets the controller passed
	to it as a listener to some buttons.
	
Ideally what'll happen is:
Program is started in main()
In main() a call is made to some method in a class in the default package that will set up the MVC.
In this method, guiCardLayout, guiController, applicationDataController, and any necessary models are
	instantiated.
Then call these methods:
	guiCardLayout.addController(guiController);
	guiCardLayout.addController(applicationDataController);
	guiController.addView(guiCardLayout);
	applicationDataController.addView(guiCardLayout);
	model.addObserver(guiCardLayout);
